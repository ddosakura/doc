### HTTP/1.1

Example:
```
$ curl -v baidu.com
*   Trying 123.125.114.144...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to baidu.com (123.125.114.144) port 80 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: baidu.com
> User-Agent: curl/7.64.1
> Accept: */*

#### About Method

1. OPTIONS 请求时可用 `*` 代替 URI
    > ```
    > OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1
    > Host: baidu.com
    > Accept: */*
    > ```
    > An OPTIONS request with an asterisk (`*`) as the request-target
    > (Section 5.3 of [RFC7230]) applies to the server in general rather
    > than to a specific resource.  Since a server's communication options
    > typically depend on the resource, the `*` request is only useful as a
    > "ping" or "no-op" type of method; it does nothing beyond allowing the
    > client to test the capabilities of the server.  For example, this can
    > be used to test a proxy for HTTP/1.1 conformance (or lack thereof).
    > 
    > If the request-target is not an asterisk, the OPTIONS request applies
    > to the options that are available when communicating with the target
    > resource.

2. TRACE 仅用于调试，容易引发 XST(Cross-Site Tracing, 跨站追踪) 攻击
    > XST 攻击是利用服务器的调试方法 Trace 进行用户信息收集的一种攻击，因为 Trace 方法是会导致服务器原样返回客户端发送的内容（Cookie，HTTP 认证信息等）。

3. CONNECT 隧道
    + [参考](https://imququ.com/post/web-proxy.html)
    + HTTP 默认走普通代理 `RFC 7230 - HTTP/1.1: Message Syntax and Routing`
    + HTTPS 走隧道代理 `RFC 7231 - HTTP/1.1: Semantics and Content`
    + 请求样例
    > the request-target
    > consists of only the host name and port number of the tunnel
    > destination, separated by a colon.
    > ```
    > CONNECT server.example.com:80 HTTP/1.1
    > Host: server.example.com:80
    > ```
    + 关于返回码
    > CONNECT is intended only for use in requests to a proxy.  An origin
    > server that receives a CONNECT request for itself MAY respond with a
    > 2xx (Successful) status code to indicate that a connection is
    > established.
    + 关于响应头
    > A server MUST NOT send any Transfer-Encoding or Content-Length header
    > fields in a 2xx (Successful) response to CONNECT.  A client MUST
    > ignore any Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header fields received
    > in a successful response to CONNECT.
    + 禁止缓存
    > Responses to the CONNECT method are not cacheable.
